- Hello, my name's [David](https://www.linkedin.com/in/david-w-079841213/).
- I have a strong desire to learn Programming and further my career!


*** IMPORTANT ***
A lot of my apps, including my portfolio, used Heroku's free hosting.
As of the 28th of November 2022 Heroku no longer supports free hosting.
I am in the midst of studying and looking for another platform to host my apps.
I'll have my apps migrated to another service soon.
Thank you for understanding.

*** UPDATE ***
Finished a project. Working on deployment.

*** UPDATE *** 
After researching Heroku alternative deployments I've settled on a technique I found on [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1CYFQ1F9N8). \
I'm waiting for an email from Adaptable. For now I've done everything I can do. I'll post once I get the email for beta access.

*** UPDATE ***
Tried a few services (Render, Adaptable, Railway). Builds keep failing. Not sure why. I'll keep at it.

*** UPDATE ***
I've successfully deployed the backend!

*** UPDATE ***
I've successfully deployed the frontend!
The [Site](https://startling-sorbet-ade77f.netlify.app/) has breaking errors, I'll provide the final update once I fix those.

*** UPDATE ***
I've updated the app and switched the db connection to MY mongodb. There's a bug on the frontend causing a *page not found* error.
This error occurs because Netlify does not support React Router out of the box. Luckily there's a simple fix. The [fix](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-deploy-a-routed-react-app-to-netlify/) isn't working for me.
I'll continue working on the error and post here once I'm done.

*** UPDATE ***
Fixed the routes issue I was having before by adding the netlify.toml file. Now there's a 'cannot read properties of undefined'. More errors to fix but I'm one step closer.

Sincerely, 
David.
