- Hello, my name's [David](https://www.linkedin.com/in/david-w-079841213/).
- I have a strong desire to learn Programming and further my career!


*** IMPORTANT ***
A lot of my apps, including my portfolio, used Heroku's free hosting.
As of the 28th of November 2022 Heroku no longer supports free hosting.
I am in the midst of studying and looking for another platform to host my apps.
I'll have my apps migrated to another service soon.
Thank you for understanding.

*** UPDATE ***
Finished a project. Working on deployment.

*** UPDATE *** 
After researching Heroku alternative deployments I've settled on a technique I found on [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1CYFQ1F9N8). \
I'm waiting for an email from Adaptable. For now I've done everything I can do. I'll post once I get the email for beta access.

*** UPDATE ***
Tried a few services (Render, Adaptable, Railway). Builds keep failing. Not sure why. I'll keep at it.

*** UPDATE ***
I've successfully deployed the backend!

*** UPDATE ***
I've successfully deployed the frontend!
The [Site](https://startling-sorbet-ade77f.netlify.app/) has breaking errors, I'll provide the final update once I fix those.

*** UPDATE ***
I've updated the app and switched the db connection to MY mongodb. There's a bug on the frontend causing a *page not found* error.
This error occurs because Netlify does not support React Router out of the box. Luckily there's a simple fix. The [fix](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-deploy-a-routed-react-app-to-netlify/) isn't working for me.
I'll continue working on the error and post here once I'm done.

*** UPDATE ***
Fixed the routes issue I was having before by adding the netlify.toml file. Now there's a 'cannot read properties of undefined'. More errors to fix but I'm one step closer.

*** UPDATE ***
Seems Reducers went rogue. Not sure if this is a frontend issue or a backend issue. I suspent my frontend is having trouble talking to the backend. Everything still works fine locally but the deployment runs into a few issues. An error called: 'NOT TYPE OF CASE IN REDUCER' and a server error of 500 show up when trying to register or sign up. The credentials are correct and I'm seeing expected behavior when I misspell the email or enter an incorrect password. It's when the correct credentials are entered that I see the errors.

*** UPDATE ***
I've gone through the logs on Adaptable's website (it's where I deployed my backend) and I've gone through the logs on Netlify (where I deployed my frontend). Correcting ALL the errors I saw in the logs. I've included more env variables in my deployment. I've updated my cors. I've swapped databases to see if that was the issue. I got the app to post a new user but that's as far as it goes. The login functionality and everything after that doesn't work. My routes are returning a 500 or 401 error. I've also made sure my mongodb network access was setup correctly (whitelisted).

Regards, 
David.
