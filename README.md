- Hello, my name's [David](https://www.linkedin.com/in/david-w-079841213/).
- I have a strong desire to learn Programming and further my career!


*** IMPORTANT ***
A lot of my apps, including my portfolio, used Heroku's free hosting.
As of the 28th of November 2022 Heroku no longer supports free hosting.
I am in the midst of studying and looking for another platform to host my apps.
I'll have my apps migrated to another service soon.
Thank you for understanding.

Sincerely, 
David.
